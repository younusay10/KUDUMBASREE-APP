# KUDUMBASREE-APP
To digitally manage a family-based money pooling system (similar to Kudmasree or Chit Fund), where:  20 family members contribute money regularly.  That pooled amount is given to a member in need, based on trust or emergency needs.  The app keeps track of who gave, who received, when, and for what purpose â€” in a transparent, organized way.
